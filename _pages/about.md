I specialize in Software Development with expertise in Python, JavaScript and C# programming languages. My recent work includes developing Generative AI solutions with FastAPI and Django as well as CRM platforms with Asp.net core, alongwith deploying and maintaining their infrastructure on Microsoft Azure Cloud.

I love working on AI driven automations and advocate for bridging the gap between Generative AI and public by the use of Cloud and Distributed Systems. I believe in technology for all. I‚Äôm involved in independent research on LLMs and how to develop infrastructure that complements democratizing the use of this technology.
